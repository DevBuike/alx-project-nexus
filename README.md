# ALX PROJECT NEXUS  
The project nexus is capstone project for the ALX ProDev FrontEnd Software Engineering course, aimed at showcasing all I've learnt during the course.  
For my project, i built a dynamic and responsive e-commerce frontend web app, collaboarting with backend dev to consume API's to display products.

## Technology
  * Web Development

## Stacks

## Challenges Faced and Solutions
  * Challenges
    * Calling API's using getServerSideProps
    * Using custom hooks
    * Rendering dynamic pages

  * Solutions
    * Studied the endpoints carefully to understand the response structure and communicated with the backend dev
    * Made research on custom hooks and how to create them
    * Researched on how to use dynamic queries when calling an API

## Best Practices and Personal Takeaways
  * Practices
    * Using industry-standard naming conventions for easier collaboration
    * Adding comments where neccessary
    * Clean folder structure
  
  * Personal Takeaways
    * Building real world projects can seem challenging (which it is.. ðŸ˜„) but seeing the project live and functional supercedes the challenges.  
    Sometimes i'll be mad that my codes are not working as expected but at the end, i still get them working and it gives a different kind of feeling; a feeling only developers can relate to.. ðŸ˜„
